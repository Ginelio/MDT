abstract = {This paper presents a novel energy management strategy (EMS) to control an isolated microgrid powered by a photovoltaic array and a wind turbine and equipped with two different energy storage systems: electric batteries and a hydrogen production and storage system. In particular, an optimal scheduling of storage devices is carried out to maximize the benefits of available renewable resources by operating the photovoltaic systems and the wind turbine at their maximum power points and by minimizing the overall utilization costs. Unlike conventional EMS based on the state-of-charge (SOC) of batteries, the proposed EMS takes into account the uncertainty due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources and electricity demand. In particular, the uncertainties are evaluated with a stochastic approach through the construction of different scenarios with corresponding probabilities. The EMS is defined by minimizing the utilization costs of the energy storage equipment. The weather conditions recorded in four different weeks between April and December are used as case studies to test the proposed EMS and the results obtained are compared with a conventional EMS based on the state-of-charge of batteries. The results show a reduction of utilization costs of about 15% in comparison to conventional SOC-based EMS and an increase of the average energy storage efficiency.}, language = {english}

abstract = {Micro-grids (MGs) are introduced as a solution for distributed energy resource (DER) units and energy storage systems (ESSs) to participate in providing the required electricity demand of controllable and non-controllable loads. In this paper, the authors study the short-term scheduling of grid-connected industrial heat and power MG which contains a fuel cell (FC) unit, combined heat and power (CHP) generation units, power-only unit, boiler, battery storage system, and heat buffer tank. The paper is aimed to solve the multi-objective MG dispatch problem containing cost and emission minimization with the considerations of demand response program and uncertainties. A probabilistic framework based on a scenario method, which is considered for load demand and price signals, is employed to overcome the uncertainties in the optimal energy management of the MG. In order to reduce operational cost, time-of-use rates of demand response programs have been modeled, and the effects of such programs on the load profile have been discussed. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, the ε-constraint method is used and a fuzzy satisfying approach has been employed to select the best compromise solution. Three cases are studied in this research to confirm the performance of the proposed method: islanded mode, grid-connected mode, and the impact of time of the use-demand response program on MG scheduling.},
